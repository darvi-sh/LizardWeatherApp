Dear Sonny,

Here is a bit of technical challenge 


1- go to this link and answer the question  (https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/7KZc2k). please follow the instruction and answer in this platform and make sure you submit your answer.

2- here is a simple design for a weather app.
you need to make the exact front end using React native(as close as you can).

requirements : 
your app should get phone location and date and knowing location and date get the weather forecast  from  yahoo weather API (https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/)
the little cycle and curved line below the screen allow user to slide the time and see 24 hours of weather.

I know the fact that you are not experienced with react native but i like to see how fast and accurate you can adopt to new technologies.


Please submit me your answers as soon as you can.
